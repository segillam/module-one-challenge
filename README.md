# HoriSEOn Webpage Refactoring

## Description

My motivation for refactoring this code was a desire to make Horiseon's webpage more accessible. The original website wasn't as accessible as it could have been. For example, the page didn't have a completely clear html structure, as it used many non-semantic tags and didn't utilize alternate image text for images.

After making some changes to the html and css pages, I believe that the new page better fits web accessibility standards. 

## Usage

Visit this page the same way you would view any other webpage at 

Click on any of the three items in the nav bar to be taken directly to that part of the page!

Right click anywhere on the page and click inspect to view semantic html elements and alternate image text!

## Credits

I used webpage starter code from urban-octo-tele on github
